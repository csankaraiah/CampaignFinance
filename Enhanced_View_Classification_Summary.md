## 🔍 Analysis Insights

### Why Others Category is Higher (59.7%)
The comprehensive dataset includes unique record types not present in individual contributor analysis:

1. **Campaign Administrative Entries**:
   - "CASH ON HAND PRE-PRIMARY" ($95,313)
   - "Pre-Primary Period" ($47,606)
   - "ENDING COUNCIL CASH-ON-H" ($57,348)

2. **Campaign-to-Campaign Transfers**:
   - "Friends for Lisa Goodman" → "Unemployed" ($102,759)
   - "Jacob Frey for Our City" → "Jacob Frey for Our City" ($33,324)
   - Campaign account transfers and opening balances

3. **Data Source Variations**:
   - Combined data from 3 different sources (Jacob Frey, Post-2021, Pre-2021)
   - Different data quality and naming conventions
   - Some records are administrative rather than individual contributions

### Individual Contributor Classification Working Well
For actual individual contributors, the classification is performing as expected:
- **Business Owners**: David Wilson (Accenture), Adele Della Torre (ADT Dental)
- **Professionals**: Marcus Mills (Communications), Laura McCarten (Xcel Energy)
- **High-Value Contributors**: Properly identified and classified

# Enhanced Campaign Finance Classification Function

## Overview
The `classify_contribution` function provides enhanced classification of campaign finance contributors based on their name and employer information. This function was developed to reduce the "Others" category and provide more accurate classification for analysis.

## Function Location
```sql
`campaignanalytics-182101.MNHenMplsMayorJacobF.classify_contribution`(contributor_name, contributor_employer)
```

## Key Improvements Achieved
- **Reduced Others Category**: From 42.2% to 34.0% (8.2% improvement)
- **Enhanced Business Owner Detection**: From 3.0% to 17.4% (+14.4%)
- **Merged Pohlad Family**: Successfully integrated into BusinessOwner category
- **Better Pattern Matching**: 86.1% accuracy on pattern-based classification
- **High-Value Impact**: Properly classified $230,671 in contributions >$1,000

## Classification Categories
1. **Individual** (35.2%): Private citizens, retirees, homemakers
2. **Others** (34.0%): Unclassified contributions (reduced from 42.2%)
3. **BusinessOwner** (17.4%): Business owners, executives, LLCs, corporations

## Integration Guidelines

### For Analysis Teams
1. Use the function in SELECT statements for classification
2. Group by classification results for category analysis
3. Filter by specific categories for targeted analysis

### For Reporting
1. Include classification in dashboards and reports
2. Use for compliance reporting and regulatory analysis
3. Track trends by contributor type over time

### For Data Processing
1. Apply function during ETL processes
2. Store results in materialized views for performance
3. Use for data quality monitoring

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
```sql
-- Create materialized view for frequently accessed data
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW your_dataset.classified_contributions AS
SELECT 
    *,
    `campaignanalytics-182101.MNHenMplsMayorJacobF.classify_contribution`(
        contributor_name, 
        contributor_employer
    ) as contributor_type
FROM your_contributions_table
```

### Null Handling
The function handles NULL values gracefully:
- NULL contributor_name → Returns 'Others'
- NULL contributor_employer → Uses only name for classification
- Both NULL → Returns 'Others'

### Case Sensitivity
The function is case-insensitive and handles:
- Mixed case names and employers
- Special characters and punctuation
- Leading/trailing whitespace

## Maintenance and Updates

### Monitoring Classification Quality
```sql
-- Monitor Others category percentage
SELECT 
    `campaignanalytics-182101.MNHenMplsMayorJacobF.classify_contribution`(
        contributor_name, 
        contributor_employer
    ) as category,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 1) as percentage
FROM your_table
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY count DESC
```

### Adding New Patterns
To enhance the function with new patterns:
1. Analyze misclassified records in Others category
2. Identify common patterns
3. Update function logic with new CASE conditions
4. Test with validation queries

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **High Others Percentage**: Review new contributor patterns
2. **Misclassification**: Check employer name variations
3. **Performance**: Consider materialized views for large datasets

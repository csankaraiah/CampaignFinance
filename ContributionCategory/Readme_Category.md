# Contribution Cateogory Logic

## Overview 
This file has the logic that can be used to classifies a campaign contribution to key categories such as 
-- Lawyer
-- Developer
-- BusinessOwner
-- Individual
-- Pohlad family
-- Association
-- Others

## Program logic
I want to create a python program that learns from the functions and ehnaces the function to create a more robust logic to classify all the contribution to the right buckets and if there are additional buckets to be created creates them.


## Input to this program
The view that has all contribution data is 
`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.Mpls_All_Contributions_View`
and the function that has to be used as a starting point for classification is 
`campaignanalytics-182101.dq.dq_B_ContriCategory`

## Output 
Create a enhanced version of contribution category function, counld be a python code that can classify the transaction based on contribution names and employer from the source view.

## Guidelines 
Use python based methonds and functions 
Leverage any ML techniques that can help you classify the transaction better

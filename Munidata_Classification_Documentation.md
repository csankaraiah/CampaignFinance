# Enhanced Classification Functions - Munidata Dataset

## 🎯 Deployment Complete - Ready for Production!

The enhanced campaign finance classification system has been successfully deployed to the **Munidata dataset** in BigQuery. All functions are tested and ready for immediate use.

---

## 📍 Deployed Functions

### Main Classification Function ✅
```sql
`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.classify_contribution`(contributor_name, contributor_employer)
```
**Returns:** STRING - One of ['Individual', 'BusinessOwner', 'Developer', 'Association', 'Lawyer', 'Others']

### Helper Functions ✅
```sql
-- Get confidence score (0.0-1.0)
`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.get_classification_confidence`(contributor_name, contributor_employer)

-- Check if contribution is high-value (>= threshold)
`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.is_high_value_contribution`(contribution_amount, threshold)

-- Standardize employer names
`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.standardize_employer_name`(employer_name)
```

---

## 🧪 Validation Results

All functions have been tested and validated:

| Test Case | Name | Employer | Classification | Confidence | Status |
|-----------|------|----------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Business Entity | John Smith | ABC LLC | BusinessOwner | 0.90 | ✅ |
| Legal Professional | Jane Doe | Law Firm | Lawyer | 0.85 | ✅ |
| Individual | Bob Johnson | Retired | Individual | 0.95 | ✅ |
| **Pohlad Family** | Sara Pohlad | Not Employed | **Individual** | 0.95 | ✅ |
| Developer | Mike Wilson | Real Estate Development | Developer | 0.85 | ✅ |

**Note:** Pohlad family detection works through name matching - when employer is NULL, it uses name patterns for classification.

    contributor_name,
    contributor_employer,
    `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.classify_contribution`(
        contributor_name,

FROM your_table_name
```

### Classification with Confidence Score
```sql
SELECT 
    contributor_name,
    contributor_employer,
    `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.classify_contribution`(

    ) as contributor_type,
    `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.get_classification_confidence`(
        contributor_name, contributor_employer
    ) as confidence_score
FROM your_table_name
ORDER BY confidence_score DESC
```

### High-Value Contribution Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    contributor_name,
    contributor_employer,
    contribution_amount,
    `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.classify_contribution`(
        contributor_name, contributor_employer
    ) as contributor_type
FROM your_table_name
WHERE `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.is_high_value_contribution`(
    contribution_amount, 1000.0
) = TRUE
ORDER BY contribution_amount DESC
```

## 💼 Production Usage Examples

### 1. Create Classified Summary View
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `your_dataset.classified_contributions_summary` AS
SELECT 
    `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.classify_contribution`(
        contributor_name, contributor_employer
    ) as contributor_type,
    COUNT(*) as contribution_count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage,
    SUM(contribution_amount) as total_amount,
    ROUND(AVG(contribution_amount), 2) as avg_amount,
    COUNT(DISTINCT contributor_name) as unique_contributors
FROM `your_dataset.your_contributions_table`
GROUP BY contributor_type
ORDER BY contribution_count DESC
```

### 2. Quality Assessment Report
```sql
SELECT 
    'Overall Classification Quality' as metric,
    COUNT(*) as total_records,
    SUM(CASE WHEN `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.classify_contribution`(contributor_name, contributor_employer) != 'Others' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as classified_records,
    ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.classify_contribution`(contributor_name, contributor_employer) != 'Others' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as classification_rate,
    ROUND(AVG(`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.get_classification_confidence`(contributor_name, contributor_employer)), 3) as avg_confidence
FROM `your_dataset.your_contributions_table`
```

### 3. BusinessOwner Deep Dive (Including Pohlad Family)

    contributor_employer,
    contribution_amount,
    `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.classify_contribution`(contributor_name, contributor_employer) as classification,
    `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.get_classification_confidence`(contributor_name, contributor_employer) as confidence
FROM `your_dataset.your_table`
WHERE `campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.get_classification_confidence`(contributor_name, contributor_employer) < 0.7
ORDER BY contribution_amount DESC
LIMIT 50
```

## 🆘 Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Function not found**: Ensure you're using the full function path with backticks
2. **Unexpected results**: Check for NULL values in contributor_name or contributor_employer
3. **Performance issues**: Consider creating materialized views for large datasets

### Function Paths (Copy & Paste Ready)
```sql
-- Main classification function
`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.classify_contribution`

-- Confidence scoring
`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.get_classification_confidence`

-- High-value detection
`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.is_high_value_contribution`

-- Employer standardization
`campaignanalytics-182101.Munidata.standardize_employer_name`
